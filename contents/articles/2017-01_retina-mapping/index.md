The observation that electrical stimulation of retina in blind patients can create visual percept led to the development of retinal prosthesis devices implanted in blind patients. For the percept to be useful, the electrical stimulation should convey information to the brain with the correct spatial coordinates.

In their paper [Retinotopic to Spatiotopic mapping in blind patients implated with the Argus II retinal prosthesis](http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2597840#149774812), Avi Caspi et al., researched blind patients implanted with a retinal prosthesis fitted to a modified [Pupil headset](https://pupil-labs.com/store/) to measure the accuracy in mapping stimulated retinal signals to the world coordinates. And to demonstrate that an eye tracker can be calibrated on the patient based on the retinal prosthesis.

In the experiment, the patient's gaze positions were recorded with timestamps synched to the onset of the stimulation using [Pupil eye tracker](https://pupil-labs.com/store/), and by indicating the location of the percepts using a handheld marker recorded with the scene camera. 

The results from the study have shown that the brain has the required signals to process stimulated retinal coordinates based on the crucial step in measuring the position of the eyes relative to the orbit to build a correct representaion of the spatial coordinates accurately.
