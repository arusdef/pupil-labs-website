We are really excited to see Pupil used in research from a group of researchers from the [Department of Experimental and Applied psychology](http://www.vupsy.nl/) at the [VU Amsterdam](http://www.vu.nl/en/) in collaboration with the [Van Gogh Museum](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en) attempted to answer how we perceive and appreciate art in a 'real life' environment. Previous studies are often set in a laboratory environment in which people are stationary.

[Francesco Walker](http://www.vupsy.nl/staff-members/francesco-walker/) (assisted by Berno Bucker, [Daniel Schreij](http://www.vupsy.nl/staff-members/daniel-schreij/) and Nicola Anderson, and supervised by prof. Jan Theeuwes) used Pupil to record the gaze patterns of adults and children as they viewed paintings in the Van Gogh museum in order to gain insight into how people look at paintings. The team leverages the open data format of Pupil and built their own analysis tool - check out their [code on github](https://github.com/dschreij/PupilEyetrackerAnalysisTools/).

The video below is a great explanation of their study and a mobile eye tracking workflow. Pupil Player is used in the screen capture to show the heat maps and gaze visualization.
