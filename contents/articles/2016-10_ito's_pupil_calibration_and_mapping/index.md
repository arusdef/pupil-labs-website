Yuta Itoh's Pupil calibration and mapping software aims to provide an easy-to-compile C++ implementation of a 3D eye-tracking method.

The software is designed for an egocentric vision eye-tracking headset with a world camera and IR filter eye camera(s). With the software, users can obtain 2D and 3D eye data.
