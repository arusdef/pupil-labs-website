Yuta Itoh, Jason Orlosky, et al., have implemented and open sourced an easy to compile C++ 3d detection and mapping implementation that runs on Windows!

Their software is compatible with Pupil hardware and enables one to obtain both 2d and 3d information:

- 3d Gaze normal vector
- 3d eyeball center w.r.t the camera
- Pupil diameter in mm
- 2d pupil ellipse size in pixels
- 2d pupil ellipse angle in degrees
- Coming soon - glint positions
