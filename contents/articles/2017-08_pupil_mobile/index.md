The application enables you to connect your Pupil eye tracking headset to your Android device via USBC. You can preview video and other sensor streams on the Android device and stream video data over a WiFi network to other computers (clients) running Pupil Capture. And also save video from your Pupil eye tracking headset other sensor data locally on your Android device.

Feel free to experiment with Pupil Mobile, but do not rely on the app to work all the time! Many features and environments are still untested. If you have trouble please open an [issue](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil-mobile-app/issues). The Pupil Labs development team will not be able to provide support via video or email for issues related to the Pupil Mobile Android App.

Currently the application only supports Pupil latest release - [Pupil v0.9.13](https://pupil-labs.com/blog/2017-08/pupil-capture-player-and-service-release-v0-9-13/). Check out the blog post to read more about what's new in the release.
