[Justus Thies](http://lgdv.cs.fau.de/people/card/justus/thies/) et al., presents a novel approach for real-time gaze-aware facial capture system to drive the photo-realistic reconstructed digital face in virtual reality. A facial reenactment that can transfer facial expressions and realistic eye appearance between a source and a target actor video.

Head-mounted displays (HMD) are able to provide immersive renderings of virtual environments. But while they are able to provide very believable immersive renderings, the headset themselves occludes the majority of the face. To overcome this, a 3D face is constructed using an RGB-D camera to capture the facial performance of the source actor and [Pupil's Oculus Rift DK2 add-on cup](https://pupil-labs.com/store/#vr-ar) was used to track the actor's eye within the HMD. The source actor's facial and gaze data is then used to drive the photo-realistic facial animations of the target video, therefore enabling gaze-aware facial reenactment.
