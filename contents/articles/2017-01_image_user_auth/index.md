Personal devices are a part of our everyday life that operate and store users private data. Such devices face an array of threats that have become a primary concern for users. The existing authentication mechanism requires users to register and remember one static password for each device. However static passwords are vulnerable to various methods of attacks. 

[Ngu Nguyen](http://ambientintelligence.aalto.fi/team.html) et al. propose a novel user authentication mechanism that uses still frames extracted from egocentric videos recored by wearable cameras.
