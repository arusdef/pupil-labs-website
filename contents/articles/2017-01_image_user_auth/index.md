Personal devices are a part of our everyday life that operate and store users private data. Such devices face an array of threats that have become a primary concern for users. The existing authentication mechanism requires users to register and remember one static password for each device at a time. However static passwords are vulnerable to various methods of attacks. 

[Ngu Nguyen](http://ambientintelligence.aalto.fi/team.html) et al., propose a novel personalized user authentication mechanism that generates an image-based passwords from egocentric videos captured by wearable cameras. 

One of the process of generating authentication challenges uses the [Pupil headset](https://pupil-labs.com/store/#pupil) to capture egocentric videos and eye fixations to select key frames that are possible to discriminate. The frames are then split into segments and grouped to form fresh and personalized image-based user authentication mechanism. The image-based mechanisms are evaluated to be comparable to static approaches while decreasing security vulnerabilities.
