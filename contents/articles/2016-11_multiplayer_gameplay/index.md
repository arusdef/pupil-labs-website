In this series of studies, the project aims to explore the invisible visual signals between players in a multiplayer gameplay! The gameplay would simulate different gaze conditions to test players interactions, varying in levels of gaze information from invisible to visible. 

Gaze can provide visual information of the player's intention. During gameplay, players monitor each other's interactions to gain and evaluate opponents intentions and formulate strategies based upon the visual information.

In conventional social interactions, gaze is largely invisible. But in a competitive gameplay environment, a player's interactions can reveal valuable information for other players. 

When gaze is augmented over the game and revealed to other players, gaze now becomes visible to other players. A shared visual information between players. With gaze being shown explicitly, players could formulate strategies and could be used as a form of deception. This work hopes to provide new insights towards gaze awareness gameplay.
