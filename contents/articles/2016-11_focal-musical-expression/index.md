Focal is an exciting experimental concept that uses an AR headset with Pupil Labs eye tracking add-ons. Focal enables musicians to have greater freedom to manage and control electronic effects while both hands are occupied.The musician can control many virtual electronic audio effects and synthesis parameters by fixating on effects displayed on the AR device. An expression foot pedal can be used to adjust the selected effects, enabling the musician to maintain posture and balance for minimal disturbance during performance.

The Focal system consists of four main parts:

- Epson Moverio BT 200 AR headset
- [Pupil eye tracking add-on for Epson BT 200](https://pupil-labs.com/store/#vr-ar)
- 2 Foot pedals
- Focal software application
- [Pupil Software](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/releases/latest)

Focal uses the Epson Moverio BT-200 with a Pupil eye tracking [add-on](https://pupil-labs.com/store/#vr-ar) and the developers/musicians have provided excellent documentation of their process! Check out their writeup [here](http://stewartgreenhill.com/articles/focal/).
