Focal is an exciting experimental concept that uses an AR headset with Pupil Labs eye tracking add-ons. Focal enables musicians to have greater freedom to manage and control electronic effects while both hands are occupied. The performer can control many virtual electronic audio effects and synthesis parameters by glancing at the effects they want to activate and using a single expression pedal to adjust those effects, while maintaining posture and balance for minimal disturbance and interaction during performance. Check out Stewart Greenhill and Cathie Travers full paper [here](http://stewartgreenhill.com/documents/FocalEyeTrackingMusicalExpressionController-NIME2016.pdf).

The Focal system consists of four main parts:
- Epson Moverio AR headset
- Pupil eye-tracker add-on
- 2 Pedals
- Focal application

Focal uses the Epson Moverio BT-200 with a Pupil eye tracking [add-on](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil-labs-website/pull/link%20to%20store) and the developers/musicians have provided excellent documentation of their process!
