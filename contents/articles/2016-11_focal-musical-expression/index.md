Focal is an experimental concept that uses AR headset with eye tracking as a digital musical controller. Enabling the musician to control many virtual electronic audio effects and synthesis parameters. The performer can control the virtual dials and switches by glancing at the effects they want to activate and using a single expression pedal to adjust those effects, while maintaining posture and balance for minimal disturbance and interaction during performance.

The Focal system consists of four main parts:
- Epson Moverio AR headset
- Pupil eye-tracker add-on
- 2 Pedals
- Focal application

Many of the electronic effects otherwise would be a multi-pedal system has been virtualised to the Focal application and singe pedal system.

The motivation behind this experiment is to enable musicians in having more freedom in managing and controlling electronic effects while both hands are occupied performing the physical instrument.
