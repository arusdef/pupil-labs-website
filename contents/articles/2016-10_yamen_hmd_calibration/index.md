[Yamen Saraiji](http://myamens.com/) have developed a Layered Telepresence system which is a layered-based approach to create a seamless interaction between multiple users from multiple locations to engage in the same conversation.

The system combines multiple locations and arrange them as layers that are presented in the same virtual space. The concept allows users to achieve multiple types of compound presence in both physical and virtual environments.
