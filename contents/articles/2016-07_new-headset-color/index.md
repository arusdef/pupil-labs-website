We have been experimenting with an in-house dyeing process to perfect the finish of our headsets. It involves careful measurement for the ideal dye to surface area of parts ratio, temperature control to produce the most saturated color, and a sealing process for product protection. Recently, we began experimenting with color alternatives to the current black headset. We are working to perfect this process for a vibrant cobalt color.
