We are experimenting with color alternatives to the current black Pupil headset. We have tried out a wide variety of colors, and there are a lot of great options, but the Pupil Dev Team really likes this vibrant cobalt color.

Our in-house dyeing process involves careful measurement for the ideal dye to surface area of parts ratio, temperature control to produce the most saturated color, and a sealing process for product protection.
