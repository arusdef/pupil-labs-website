We are excited to announce the release of our new USB C clip for Pupil hardware.

The new clip enables us to connect and power USB 3 devices and extend the modularity of the Pupil platform. It also enables Pupil hardware to connect to more devices - like smart-phones! Upgrading from a USB 2 hub also enables us to ensure more that adequate power will be supplied to our hardware as some hosts impose very conservative limitations on USB 2.

The new clip will be included in all Pupil headsets. All existing Pupil headsets can be upgraded to the new clip. We will be posting the clip on the store soon -- stay tuned.
