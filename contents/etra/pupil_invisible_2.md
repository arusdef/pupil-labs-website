subtitle: We are developing new eye tracking hardware

### Zero Setup
We want to lower the setup and use barrier using automatic continuous calibration and robust tracking algorithms.

### Accessible
Pupil Invisible will plug into your Android smartphone or laptop. All software is open source. You will have access to all raw data. We are working hard on making hardware as affordable as possible for low entry barrier and scalable studies.
