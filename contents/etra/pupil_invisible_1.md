### Invisible to You 
The cameras are so tiny, and so close to your eye - they practically disappear.

### Invisible to Others
We integrate these tiny eye tracking cameras into classic frame designs, so that they will look just like normal glasses. You will have to get up close to spot the difference.  

### All day. Every day.
Pupil Invisible is designed to feel just like normal glasses. They be configured come with prescription lenses or shaded lenses. You can wear Pupil Invisible for all day monitoring and long term studies.
