title: Pupil Invisible
subtitle: We are developing new eye tracking hardware
---

### Invisible to You 
The cameras are so tiny, and so close to your eye - they virtually disappear.

### Invisible to Others
We integrate these tiny eye tracking cameras into classic frame designs, so that they will look just like normal glasses. You will have to get up close to spot the difference.  

### All day. Every day.
Pupil Invisible is designed to feel just like normal glasses. They be configured come with prescription lenses or shaded lenses. You can wear Pupil Invisible for all day monitoring and long term studies.

### Zero Setup
We want to lower the setup and use barrier using automatic continuous automatic calibration and robust tracking algorithms.

### Accessible
Pupil Invisible will plug into your Android smartphone or laptop. All software is open source. You will have access to all raw data. We are working hard on making hardware as affordable as possible for low entry barrier and scalable studies.
