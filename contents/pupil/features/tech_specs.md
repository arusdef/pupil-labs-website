Eye tracking performance is determined in equal parts by the hardware and software. 

We constantly work on our algorithms and codebase, so you can expect steady improvement and new features. In a test from 2014 we measured a gaze accuracy of 0.6° with a precision of 0.08°. For more details check out our [technical report][1].

Pupil headsets connect to a Tablet, Laptop, or PC via USB2.0. The headset is configurable with different cameras, so you can get the hardware you need: from high resolution capture at 30hz to low latency (5.7ms) 120hz eye and scene video. 

See the [configurator][2] for options, full technical specs for cameras, and sample videos.
