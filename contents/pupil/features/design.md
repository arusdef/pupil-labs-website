A lot of design and engineering thought & energy has gone into getting the ergonomics of the headset just right.

It is designed to fit snugly, securely, and comfortably. Cameras can be adjusted to accommodate a wide range of users. The headset is made from laser sintered PA12, an extremely flexible, durable, and lightweight material.
