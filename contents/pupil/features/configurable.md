Pupil headsets are 3D printed frames that you wear like a pair of glasses.

Cameras record your field of view and your eye movements. Eye movements can be captured at high speed - up to 120 frames per second. Data is correlated with Pupil Capture software. 

Pupil is designed as a modular system to support the diverse needs of researchers in the fields of eye tracking and egocentric vision. Detailed technical information can be found in our [published report](https://www.google.co.th/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB8QFjABahUKEwj--p684uHHAhVQSo4KHYc3AQs&url=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1405.0006&usg=AFQjCNGmO7drrfoRZZRNjCVVVyfs2tslRw "Pupil: An Open Source Platform for Pervasive Eye Tracking and Mobile Gaze-based Interaction").
