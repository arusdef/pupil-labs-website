Pupil headsets are 3D printed frames that you wear like a pair of glasses.

Cameras record your field of view and your eye movements. Data is correlated with Pupil Capture software. 

Pupil is designed as a modular system to support the diverse needs of researchers in the fields of eye tracking and egocentric vision. Detailed technical information can be found in our [published report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0006 "Pupil: An Open Source Platform for Pervasive Eye Tracking and Mobile Gaze-based Interaction").
