At Pupil Labs we do research and development, with an emphasis on design.

We are a small team working on projects that we find challenging and exciting. It is our goal with every aspect of our work to learn something new.

Currently we’re focusing our development efforts on Pupil – a mobile eye tracking headset and open source software framework. We are excited about this project, because it allows us to work at the intersection of many fields and to interact with a diverse community of researchers.

We believe in open source. We have formed our business around an open source model, and have grown with our community.

By joining us at this early stage, you will have the chance to make a big impact, work on projects that you are genuinely passionate about, and challenge your capacities. You will not just be another cog in the machine. Because we are a small company, you will expected to wear many hats - to be agile, creative, and self-motivated.

We’re always looking for excellent people. Send us a note at <mailto:jobs@pupil-labs.com> - we’d love to hear from you.
