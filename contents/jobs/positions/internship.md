We are looking to hire paid interns to work at Pupil Labs. We are accepting internship applications on a rolling basis.

Internships are project based. This means that as an intern at Pupil Labs you will be in charge of your own project, and will work closely with our team in the process of development. Projects will be designed such that they can be completed within the internship period. Ideal internship periods are for 6 months working at our office in Berlin. However, we are willing to discuss remote work and durations.

Currently we are looking for interns to work on projects within the following areas:

  + *Software Development* - You should have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science or be pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science with a solid foundation in computer vision. You will be working on developing software written in Python, C, and/or Cython.
  + *Design* - You should have practical experience or be pursuing a degree in a design field (Industrial Design, UI/UX, Graphic Design, Web Design/Development). Projects will be structured based on your area of interest and expertise.
  + *Fabrication* - You love building things with your hands and are a tinkerer at heart. You have a passion for quality and strong attention to details. Experience with soldering, assembling electronics, and testing is a plus.
