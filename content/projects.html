{% block overview %}
## Overview
**Pupil** is a head mounted mobile eye tracking platform.  With **Pupil**, you will be able to record gaze positions.

You can customize the software to your needs, build your own plugins, and contribute back to the community!

{% block hardware %}
## Hardware
Pupil headsets are 3D printed head mounts that you wear like a pair of glasses. Pupil headsets hold two cameras. One camera tracks and records your eye movements, and another camera records your field of view.  Pupil headsets are lightweight and compatible with most modern computers with 2 USB ports.  

Pupil headsets currently comes in two flavors - **Pupil One** and **Pupil One +**.

## Open Source Development 
Much work went into making the software modular and accessible.  You can develop and extend to suit your needs.  We want **Pupil** software to serve as an experiment and development platform for **Pupil** developers. 

Developers, &uuml;ber-nerds, and code explorers -- you can clone the repository and install all dependencies yourself to run **Pupil** directly from the Python source.  Follow build instructions for your platform of choice.
